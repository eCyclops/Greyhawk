                "#text": "When the Bone March was created by the Overking, a further outpost was desired and the Aerdi banners pushed northward as far as the Timberway. A military commander was appointed to see to the establishment of a secure territory and lumbering was gotten underway, as the great pines of the area were highly desirable in shipbuilding. The active commander soon sent such a stream of riches southward (he was a just man, friendly with the Dwerfolk, and an able tactician, too) – accompanying them with detailed reports of successful actions against the last of the Frost Barbarians in the area – that the Overking took notice. After a raiding fleet was roundly beaten, the Overking elevated this general to the nobility, creating him Baron Ratik. Thereafter a succession of his descendants have ruled the fief, bravely combating raiders so as to gain their respect and even friendship from some, while humans and demi-humans alike prospered. When the hordes of humanoids began attacking, Ratik had ample warning from the dwarves dwelling in the mountains. Companies of men and gnomes hurried west to aid their countrymen against the invaders, while couriers were sent south (and north) to alert the people there. Resistance was so fierce that the area was bypassed, and the attackers fell instead upon the Bone March. The isolated barony has since been ruled as a fief palatine. The Baron’s forces are able to defend Ratik, but they are not strong enough to dislodge the humanoids from the mountains of the plain to the south. The baronial levies consist of schiltrons of spearmen and a small force of light cavalry. Large dwarven contingents are available in time of need, as are several companies of sturdy gnomes. A force of men-at-arms, crossbowmen, and mounted sergeants comprises the regular army of Ratik, with bow armed woodsmen patrolling the north and sling-equipped hillrunners watching the southern borders."
